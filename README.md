As the graduation project for my minor in Computer Science and Information Technologies, me and two my friends developed a Java-based online compiler system aimed at simplifying the assessment process. This system allows students to upload their code, automatically compare it with correct solutions, and store the results in a centralized database. Supported by a user-friendly interface, the system is designed to speed up the evaluation process for both students and instructors, saving time. By automatically scoring code accuracy, the project aims to enhance the efficiency of software education.
